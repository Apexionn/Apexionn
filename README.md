### Hey there, I'm Apexion! 👨‍💻

I'm a Computer Science student at BINUS University, passionate about turning ideas into reality through code. With a blend of front-end and back-end development skills, I enjoy creating seamless digital experiences, whether it's building robust web apps or crafting mobile solutions. Lately, I've been diving deep into the world of **Game Development**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**, curious about how these fields intersect. From exploring how AI can transform gaming experiences to uncovering insights through data analysis, I'm excited to expand my skillset and explore new technologies that are shaping the future.
